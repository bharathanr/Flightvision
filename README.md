Flightvision
=============

A Raytracer coded up in C++.

Date for Initial Release
==========================
23rd July 2014 - Get "A Dream of Flight" rendered.

TODO
=====
1. Create local copy and add in a basic UI.
2. Create the Sphere primitive, Rays, Vectors, Cameras, Matrices
3. Write XML parsing code to read in the scene description.
4. Test basic coloured sphere rendering.
5. Add in simple diffuse lighting.
6. Add in specular highlights.
7. Add in a reflective sphere shader.
8. Add in a refractive sphere shader.
9. Create the triangle primitive.
10. Create the textured triangle primitive.
11. Test rendering for both primitives. Use a square for the texture test.
12. Write code to import models made up of triangles, normals, texture-coordinate data etc.
13. Test model rendering.
14. Figure out how to add a Skydome. Consider using a Raytracing/Rasterization hybrid if that'll be easier.
15. Find and import a suitable model airplane.
16. Figure out how to do lens flare effects, sunlight etc. 
17. Consider using a PhotonMapper. If this sounds like a good idea, then write up the code!!
18. Test PhotonMapper as necessary. Otherwise, go on to render final poster.
